Heat template for deploying magento with the following:
  - 1 salt-master instance
  - 1 MySQL instance w/ salt-minion
  - 1 haproxy instance w/ salt-minion
  - n apache2/php5/memcached/magento instances with synchronized docroots

Still need to work on a healthcheck for magento
Need to clean up inputs to template and add input for choosing flavors.
  - Possibly allow choice of flavor for each type of minion
